# COVID-19-Data

This program was created using MATLAB and data from HealthData.gov. 

This program was created in order to raise awareness for the severity of the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

The user is able to select any state or region listed in the dropdown menu of the program. 
So far, two graphs have been displayed: Total Cases and Total Deaths by state. 
In the near future, ICU bed capacity will be included in the program.
